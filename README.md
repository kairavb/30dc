   wage INTEGER,

CREATE TABLE users (

In help.txt you can find my thinking on how i imagined the project would work,
and over time how I imagined the layout of my project,  
like a blueprint that changes as the idea is shaped by continuous efforts over time.

also created virtual env so that i can isolate my working environment 
from my global environment. (Linux)

```
python3.10 -m venv "chefenv"
source chefenv/bin/activate
```

I am working day and night since starting of this project, may upload timelapse in future  
I have learned a lot through this 5 day project challenge,
this is fun !
