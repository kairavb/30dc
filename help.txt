my choice of stack would be this:-

frontend:-
html, css, js
possibly will use no code low code platforms like,
Framer, Wordpress or some other platforms

how will I implement?

Homepage:- Intro, chef login/signup, investor login/signup

loginpage:- login
signuppage:- signup

Browsepage:- chefs listings from all around the world
    options of purchasing the chef for salaray,
    or investing in its hotel or chef business

chef dashboard:-
    change password, delete listing/account, invested (y/n)

investor dashboard:-
    delete account, change password
    how many chefs the investor own or have invested in

user table:- id, username, hash

chef table:- username, status, intro, wage, exp, mail

investor table:- username, chef-username

CREATE TABLE chef (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
   status TEXT,
   intro TEXT,
   wage INTEGER,
   exp INTEGER,
   mail TEXT,
   views INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE investor (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
   viewed INTEGER,
   contacted INTEGER,
   tohire INTEGER,
   balance INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE users (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
   username TEXT NOT NULL,
   type BOOL NOT NULL,
