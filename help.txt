    delete account, change password
    how many chefs the investor own or have invested in

user table:- id, username, hash

chef table:- username, status, intro, wage, exp, mail

investor table:- username, chef-username

CREATE TABLE chef (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
   status BOOL,
   intro TEXT,
   wage INTEGER,
